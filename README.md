# Elevator Simulator

## Description
This is an elevator simulator that mimics the operation of multiple elevators in a multi-story building. Users can press buttons on different floors to call an elevator, and the program simulates the movement of elevators between floors.

## Features
- Configurable number of elevators
- Configurable number of floors
- Graphical display of elevators and floors
- Timer showing estimated arrival time of the elevator
- Smart algorithm for selecting the nearest elevator

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Pygame using the command:
3. Download the project files to your computer

## Running the Simulation
Run the `main.py` file to start the simulation:

## Usage
- Click on floor buttons to call an elevator
- Watch elevators move between floors
- The timer above each floor displays the estimated arrival time of the elevator

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main file to run the simulation
- `building.py`: Contains the main logic for the building and elevators
- `elevator.py`: Defines elevator behavior
- `floor.py`: Defines floor structure
- `button.py`: Defines floor buttons
- `timer.py`: Handles time calculations
- `show_timer.py`: Displays the timer on screen
- `settings.py`: Contains constants and settings for the project

## Notes
- The number of floors and elevators can be changed in the `settings.py` file
- Image and sound files are located in the `media` folder
